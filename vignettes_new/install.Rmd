To install Seurat, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.0 or greater is required. We also recommend installing [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

# ![Seurat v5:](../output/images/SeuratV5.png){#id .class width=60 height=60} Seurat 5: Install from GitHub

Copy the code below to install Seurat v5:

```{r required, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
```

The following packages are not required but are used in many Seurat v5 vignettes:

* SeuratData: automatically load datasets pre-packaged as Seurat objects
* Azimuth: local annotation of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq queries across multiple organs and tissues
* SeuratWrappers: enables use of additional integration and differential expression methods
* Signac: analysis of single-cell chromatin data

```{r additional, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat-data", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("satijalab/azimuth", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat-wrappers", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("stuart-lab/signac", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
```

Seurat v5 utilizes BPCells to support analysis of extremely large datasets:

```{r bpcells, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bnprks/BPCells", quiet = TRUE)
```

For more information on BPCells installation, please see the [installation instructions](https://bnprks.github.io/BPCells/#installation). For macOS users, the following GitHub issues concerning [M1 chip installation](https://github.com/bnprks/BPCells/issues/6) and [compiler compatibility](https://github.com/bnprks/BPCells/issues/3) may be of use.
